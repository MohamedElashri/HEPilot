LHCb event characteristics
ν (nu) : The average number of pp interactions per bunch crossing
Only used in MC
μ (mu): The average number of visible pp interactions per bunch crossing
The only thing we can measure at LHCb
We measure, assuming L0 selects ALL visible interactions, i.e.
(at 7 TeV, a bit less at 8 TeV)
Pile-up: the average number of pp interactions in visible events
The relevant quantity for the Hlt processing time
Pile-up
The average pile-up is not what we see in the Hlt if we have a biasing L0

20. Successfully reconstructed: a track must have at least70%of its associated hits originating from a single MonteCarlo particle
21. Ghost tracks: reconstructed tracks that are not matched to a true MonteCarlo particle
22. Cloned tracks: several reconstructed tracks that origin from the same particle
