LHCb event characteristics
ν (nu) : The average number of pp interactions per bunch crossing
Only used in MC
μ (mu): The average number of visible pp interactions per bunch crossing
The only thing we can measure at LHCb
We measure
, assuming L0 selects ALL visible interactions, i.e.
(at 7 TeV, a bit less at 8 TeV)
Pile-up: the average number of pp interactions in visible events
The relevant quantity for the Hlt processing time
Pile-up
The average pile-up is not what we see in the Hlt if we have a biasing L0

Successfully reconstructed
: a track must have at least
70%
of its associated hits originating from a single MonteCarlo particle
Ghost tracks
: reconstructed tracks that are not matched to a true MonteCarlo particle
Cloned tracks
: several reconstructed tracks that origin from the same particle
Track Types
:
-- 0 = Unknown
-- 1 = Velo track
-- 2 = 2D Velo track
-- 3 = Long (or forward) track
-- 4 = Upstream track
-- 5 = Downstream track
-- 6 = seed track
-- 7 = muon track
-- 8 = calorimeter cosmic track
-- 9 = TT track
