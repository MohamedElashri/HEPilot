The Discovery Module is responsible for finding candidate documents and returning a registry with metadata that enables prioritization and acquisition planning.

Indico adapters MUST traverse event hierarchies and capture speaker metadata. Internal Notes MUST respect repository ACLs and classification flags. TWiki adapters MUST resolve internal links and page histories. Code adapters (code_docs, code) MUST authenticate with repository API, traverse file trees, and identify documentation or source files for processing.",
