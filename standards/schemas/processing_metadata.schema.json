  "description": "Metadata documenting the processing pipeline execution for a document. Captures which processor was used, timing information, and any warnings encountered during format conversion. This enables reproducibility tracking and quality monitoring. Processing requirements: MUST preserve section hierarchy, MUST convert tables to GitHub-Flavoured Markdown, MUST preserve LaTeX equations ($...$ and $$...$$), SHOULD maintain cross-references and citations, MUST handle multi-column layouts. Content filtering: strip embedded images (unless figure extraction enabled), remove navigation elements/headers/footers, exclude adverts/boilerplate, eliminate duplicate content blocks.",
