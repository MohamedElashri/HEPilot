  "description": "Output from the Acquisition Module documenting downloaded documents with cryptographic verification and validation status. The Acquisition Module downloads artefacts while preserving provenance, enforcing quotas, and ensuring integrity. Download requirements: MUST implement exponential-backoff retry logic, MUST honour HTTP/HTTPS rate-limit headers, SHOULD use HTTP Range requests with 16 MiB blocks for artefacts larger than 1 GiB. Validation: Every file MUST pass SHA-256 and SHA-512 hash verification, format/extension consistency check, minimum size threshold, and virus scan for external sources.",
